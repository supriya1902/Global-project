            <h3>Bald Eagle</h3>
            <p><h3>The Success Story of the Bald Eagle</h3><br>
                The bald eagle (Haliaeetus leucocephalus) is one of the greatest success stories of wildlife conservation in the United States. Once on the brink of extinction, this iconic bird has made a remarkable comeback thanks to strong conservation efforts.
                <br>
                <h4>The Decline</h4>
                By the mid-20th century, the bald eagle population had dropped drastically due to:
                <br>
                DDT pesticide use ‚Äì weakened eggshells, leading to failed reproduction.<br>
                Hunting and poaching ‚Äì eagles were often killed due to misconceptions about them preying on livestock.<br>
                Habitat destruction ‚Äì deforestation and human expansion reduced nesting areas.<br>
                In 1963, fewer than 500 nesting pairs remained in the lower 48 states.<br>
                <br><br>
                <h4>The Recovery Efforts</h4>
                Several actions helped bring bald eagles back from the edge of extinction:<br>
                ‚úÖ DDT Ban (1972) ‚Äì The U.S. banned the harmful pesticide, allowing eggs to develop properly.<br>
                ‚úÖ Endangered Species Act (1973) ‚Äì Provided legal protection and habitat conservation.<br>
                ‚úÖ Captive Breeding & Reintroduction ‚Äì Conservationists raised and released young eagles into the wild.<br>
                ‚úÖ Strict Hunting Regulations ‚Äì Laws were enforced to protect eagles from poaching.<br>
                <br><br>
                <h4>The Comeback</h4>
                By 2007, the bald eagle population had recovered so significantly that it was removed from the Endangered Species List. Today, over 300,000 bald eagles exist across North America!
                <br><br>
                The bald eagle‚Äôs revival is a testament to effective conservation policies and environmental responsibility, proving that endangered species can recover when given proper protection.

            <h3>Humpback Whale</h3>
            <p><h3>Success Story of the Humpback Whale üêã</h3><br>
                The humpback whale (Megaptera novaeangliae) is one of the greatest success stories in marine conservation. Once on the brink of extinction due to commercial whaling, this species has made a remarkable recovery thanks to global conservation efforts.
                <br><br>
                <h4>Threats That Pushed Humpback Whales to the Edge...</h4><br>
                In the 19th and 20th centuries, humpback whale populations were decimated by commercial whaling, with numbers dropping by over 90%. By the mid-20th century, there were fewer than 5,000 individuals left in the world's oceans.
                <br><br>
                <h4>Key Conservation Efforts</h4>
                <br><br>
                1. Whaling Bans & Legal Protection
                In 1966, the International Whaling Commission (IWC) banned commercial hunting of humpback whales.<br>
                The Endangered Species Act (ESA) and the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA) provided further protections in the U.S.<br>
                <br><br>
                2. Global Awareness & Conservation Programs<br>
                Organizations like WWF, NOAA, and IWC launched conservation programs to protect whale habitats.<br>
                Strict anti-poaching laws and marine sanctuaries were established.
                <br><br>
                3. Reduced Ocean Pollution & Fishing Regulations.<br>
                Restrictions on ship traffic and fishing gear reduced whale entanglements.<br>
                Efforts to combat ocean pollution helped improve the species‚Äô habitat.<br>
                <h4>A Remarkable Comeback:</h4><br>
                Thanks to these conservation efforts, humpback whale populations have rebounded significantly.
                <br><br>
                Current population estimates: Over 80,000 individuals globally!<br>
                In 2016, the U.S. removed most humpback whale populations from the endangered species list.<br>
                They are still protected under the Marine Mammal Protection Act to prevent future threats.<br>
                <h5>Ongoing Challenges:</h5><br>
                Although humpback whales have made an incredible recovery, climate change, entanglement in fishing gear, and ship strikes remain concerns. Conservation efforts continue to ensure their long-term survival.
